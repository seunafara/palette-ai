# palette-ai
Generates a matching color palette - primaryColor, secondaryColor, matchPrimary_Secondary, textColor

# Demo guide

Clicking generate provides a new color match. The AI scores the match, if above 0.5 (50%) the match is painted on the screen if not we recursively call our generate function


If the generated color is something you like, you can click save, this tells the AI that the guess output should be labelled as 1.
The more saves you click, the more the AI matches the guess with what was saved
